<h2><a name="Crowns_and_Bridges_(also_Inlays_and_Onlays):">Crowns and Bridges 
(also Inlays and Onlays):</a></h2>

<p>1- Crowns and bridges usually take 2 or 3 appointments to complete. On the 
first appointment, the tooth/teeth are prepared, impressions are taken, and a 
temporary crown is placed on your tooth/teeth.</p>

<p>2- You may experience sensitivity, gum soreness, and slight discomfort on the 
tooth/teeth; it should subside after the placement of the permanent crown(s).</p>

<p>3- Whenever anesthesia is used, avoid chewing on your teeth until the 
numbness has worn off.</p>

<p class="style1">4- A temporary crown is usually made of plastic-based material 
or soft metal. It can break if too much pressure is placed on it. The crown may 
also come off; if it does, save the crown and call our office. The temporary 
crown is placed to protect the tooth and prevent other teeth from moving. If it 
comes off it should be replaced as soon as possible. To avoid losing your 
temporary, do not chew on sticky or hard food (chewing gum, ice). Try to chew on 
the opposite side of the temporary as much as possible.</p>

<p class="style1">5- Continue your normal brushing but be careful while flossing 
around the temporaries (remove the floss gently from the side). If it is 
difficult to get the floss between the temporary and surrounding teeth, refrain 
from flossing until you receive your permanent crown.</p>

<p class="style1">6- After the permanent restoration is placed you may feel 
slight pressure for a few days. Also, the bite may feel different for a day or 
two. But if after 2-3 days the bite still feels uneven or if you feel discomfort 
when chewing on the tooth, call our office. Delaying the necessary adjustments 
may damage the tooth permanently.</p>

<p>7- Call our office if you are in pain or if you have any questions.</p>

<h2><a name="Root_Canal_Treatment:">Root Canal Treatment:</a></h2>

<p>1- You may experience moderate pain and sensitivity to pressure on your 
tooth. Also, you may feel gum soreness for few days after your treatment. The 
healing process may take several days but the pain and discomfort should subside 
gradually.</p>

<p>2- Take any medication that was prescribed for you according to instructions.</p>

<p>3- Usually a temporary filling has been placed on your tooth; do not bite on 
the tooth for one hour and while you are numb. Also, until the permanent 
restoration is placed, be very gentle with the tooth. Try to chew with the 
opposite side.</p>

<p>4- Continue your brushing and flossing.</p>

<p>5- Follow up with the placement of your permanent restoration as you have 
been advised. Any unnecessary delay in placement of final restoration may damage 
the tooth permanently.</p>

<h2><a name="Denture_Delivery:">Denture Delivery:</a></h2>

<h2><a name="Bone_Graft_Surgery">Bone Graft Surgery</a></h2>

<p class="style1">You have just had surgery completed for the reduction of 
periodontal pocketing and/or for replacement of bone in an area where pathology 
existed, or in conjunction with endosseous dental implant surgical placement 
with or without platelet addition to the bone graft. You will be advised of the 
particular procedure and pertinent directions relative to your treatment 
modality. Whether you were put to sleep for this procedure or were only given 
local anesthesia, the post-operative instructions remain the same.</p>

<p class="style1">You will have several sutures (stitches) placed at the 
surgical site. These sutures may or may not be resorbable. If you have been told 
that you received external silk sutures, they have to be removed by us. The 
sutures will cause a pulling of your tissue over the bone grafting site. Since 
the bone graft site will have approximately 15 % more bone fill than what was 
naturally there, it is imperative that you do not pull up your lips or cheeks to 
show or examine the area. The undue pressure will cause the sutures to widen 
away from the surgical site, expose bone, create more pain, and delay healing 
dramatically. This delay can lead to the need for the area to be sutured again 
when you are seen for your 1 week post-surgical evaluation. The sutures will 
remain in place for 2 to 3 weeks depending on the size of the graft, the 
severity of the pathology, and the condition of the tissue being sutured.</p>

<p class="style1">Your doctor will tell you what time period to expect, but keep 
in mind that this is not etched in stone and the doctor may extend the time 
before your sutures are removed to assure adequate healing and to avoid surgical 
regression.</p>

<p class="style1">You also may have a periodontal pack placed over the surgical 
site. The pack is pink in color and impregnated with antibiotic, which will 
protect the surgical site from infection and any washout of the particulate bone 
utilized to restore your jaw. The pack should be left in place for as long as 
possible. If a pack is placed the doctor will remove the packing at your 1 week 
follow up and decide if the packing should be replaced or kept off. Usually the 
packing is kept on for 7 to 10 days at a minimum. You must return to the office 
if your pack falls off before you are seen for your 1 week follow up.</p>

<p class="style1">Your maintenance during healing has to be completed carefully. 
You can brush in every area except where the periodontal pack is placed. It is 
imperative that you use NO ASTRINGENTS such as mouth wash or antiseptic 
solutions during the healing period of your bone graft. Listerine, Viadent, or 
any other potentially caustic agent can RUIN your bone grafting procedure if 
contaminated, and require a replacement bone graft. The doctor and our staff 
will reiterate this to you at, during, and after your bone graft surgical 
procedure. After the first stages of healing are satisfactory, we will provide 
you with normal saline and instruct you on how to use it (with or without the 
addition of salt), as well as irrigation syringes for cleaning the surgical 
site.</p>

<p class="style1">Since bone grows and heals slowly, it requires conditions 
conducive to a proper environment and blood supply. Thus, it is imperative that 
immediately after your bone graft you alter your diet, as you would for any oral 
surgical procedure. This means that you should not eat anything that is too 
large, too hot, or too sticky. Your food should be tepid or on the cool side. 
Any food that is too hot will have a deleterious effect on your surgical 
procedure. Common sense must be used in determining what should be done or 
avoided. If for some reason you have questions about anything post-surgically, 
please call the office and we will inform you of the proper action to take.</p>

<p class="style1">Smoking after any oral surgical procedure will ALWAYS delay or 
disrupt normal healing due to a decrease in oxygenation of the tissue that is 
healing. Smoking should therefore be stopped for the first 7 to 10 days to allow 
for adequate initial tissue closure. Complete epithilization (closure) and wound 
healing normally takes a minimum of 21 days from the day the surgery was 
completed under ideal healing conditions, and with no other underlying systemic 
causes such as Diabetes Melitus, etc.</p>

<p class="style1">Bone grafting is a very predictable surgical procedure when 
done correctly and when patient cooperation is adhered to. Please try to be 
reasonable in understanding that this procedure has inherent risks associated 
with it, as stated in your informed consents. Some of these risks are also 
pertinent to your post-operative care.</p>

<p class="style1">We want nothing more than a perfect outcome with the surgical 
procedures that you are having done to rehabilitate your bone. This can only be 
attained with your cooperation. Please feel free to communicate with us at any 
time to make sure that the procedures you are having are properly maintained. No 
question is ever perceived by our office as being silly or unreasonable. We 
would rather have questions answered immediately than risk the chance that the 
procedure will not go as planned, especially from omissions that are 
preventable.</p>

<p class="style1">As stated above and outlined in your informed consents, please 
remember that there are some instances when no matter what is done, the outcome 
is not perfect. There are even infrequent occasions when a surgery may have to 
be redone; these situations are neither the doctor’s nor the patient’s fault. </p>
